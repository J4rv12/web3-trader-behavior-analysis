## Overview

This project investigates the relationship between **trader behavior** and **market sentiment** (Fear vs. Greed) using two key datasets:

1. **Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset**, tracking daily classification states such as *Extreme Fear*, *Fear*, *Neutral*, *Greed*, and *Extreme Greed*.  
2. **Hyperliquid Trader Data**, capturing trade-level information including position size, direction, and realized profit/loss (PnL).

The goal is to identify how **profitability, risk-taking, and trading volume** align or diverge from prevailing sentiment conditions, and to uncover potential behavioral signals that can guide smarter trading strategies.

## Summary table

|Aspect|Observation|Implication|
|------|-----------|-----------|
|Profitability|Highest during Extreme Greed|Experienced traders exploit market euphoria|
|PnL Volatility|Max in Extreme Fear & Greed|Requires strong risk management|
|Trade Size|Largest during Fear|Confident traders accumulate positions|
|Trade Direction|Selling bias in extremes|Profit-taking and hedging behavior|
|Median PnL|~0 across all states|Few trades drive most outcomes|

## Conclusion

The data reveals a **clear behavioral rhythm** between trader activity and sentiment:

- **Greed fuels performance**, but mainly for traders who **sell into strength**.  
- **Fear fuels volume**, led by **high-capital actors** positioning for recovery.  
- **Volatility peaks** at both extremes, demanding robust risk controls.

These insights reinforce that **market sentiment is both a signal and a trap**, understanding when crowd psychology diverges from rational positioning can offer a significant trading edge.
